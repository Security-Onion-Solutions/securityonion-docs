Description
===========

From https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef :

    | The Cyber Swiss Army Knife
    | CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all
      manner of "cyber" operations within a web browser. These
      operations include simple encoding like XOR or Base64, more
      complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and
      hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating
      hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character
      encodings, and much more.

    The tool is designed to enable both technical and non-technical
    analysts to manipulate data in complex ways without having to deal
    with complex tools or algorithms. It was conceived, designed, built
    and incrementally improved by an analyst in their 10% innovation
    time over several years. Every effort has been made to structure the
    code in a readable and extendable format, however it should be noted
    that the analyst is not a professional developer.
