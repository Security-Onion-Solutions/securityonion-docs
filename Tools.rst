   <h3>Thanks</h3>

| Security Onion would like to thank the following open-source projects
  for their contribution to our community!
| 
| argus
| http://www.qosient.com/argus/
| "Argus is a data network transaction auditing tool that categorizes
  network packets that match the libpcap filter expression into a
  protocol-specific network flow transaction model. Argus reports on the
  transactions that it discovers, as periodic network flow data, that is
  suitable for historical and near real-time processing for forensics,
  trending and alarm/alerting." As of Security Onion 16.04.4.1, this
  tool is no longer included in Security Onion.

  testing. dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy
  passively monitor a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail,
  files, etc.). arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the
  interception of network traffic normally unavailable to an attacker
  (e.g, due to layer-2 switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement active
  monkey-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions
  by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI."

  The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't
  only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and
  RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files
  between a covered channel, and many other features."
| 
| hunt
| "Advanced packet sniffer and connection intrusion. Hunt is a program
  for intruding into a connection, watching it and resetting it. Note
  that hunt is operating on Ethernet and is best used for connections
  which can be watched through it. However, it is possible to do
  something even for hosts on another segments or hosts that are on
  switched ports."
| 
| labrea
| http://labrea.sourceforge.net/labrea-info.html
| "LaBrea takes over unused IP addresses, and creates virtual servers
  that are attractive to worms, hackers, and other denizens of the

| mergecap
| http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/mergecap.html
| "Mergecap is a program that combines multiple saved capture files into
  a single output file specified by the -w argument. Mergecap knows how
  to read libpcap capture files, including those of tcpdump, Wireshark,
  and other tools that write captures in that format."
| 
| netsed
| "The network packet altering stream editor NetSED is small and handful
  utility designed to alter the contents of packets forwarded thru your
  network in real time. It is really useful for network hackers in
  following applications: black-box protocol auditing - whenever there
  are two or more proprietary boxes communicating over undocumented
  protocol (by enforcing changes in ongoing transmissions, you will be
  able to test if tested application is secure), fuzz-alike experiments,
  integrity tests - whenever you want to test stability of the
  application and see how it ensures data integrity, other common
  applications - fooling other people, content filtering, etc etc -
  choose whatever you want to. It perfectly fits ngrep, netcat and
  tcpdump tools suite."

| 
| p0f
| http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/
| "P0f is a tool that utilizes an array of sophisticated, purely passive
  traffic fingerprinting mechanisms to identify the players behind any
  incidental TCP/IP communications (often as little as a single normal
  SYN) without interfering in any way. Version 3 is a complete rewrite
  of the original codebase, incorporating a significant number of
  improvements to network-level fingerprinting, and introducing the
  ability to reason about application-level payloads (e.g., HTTP)."

  show you the result."
| 
| scapy
| http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/
| "Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation program. It is
  able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send
  them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much
  more. It can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning,
  tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery (it
  can replace hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump,
  tethereal, p0f, etc.). It also performs very well at a lot of other
  specific tasks that most other tools can't handle, like sending
  invalid frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics
  (VLAN hopping+ARP cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted
  channel, ...), etc."

| 
| Squert
| http://www.squertproject.org/
| "Squert is a web application that is used to query and view event data
  stored in a Sguil database (typically IDS alert data). Squert is a
  visual tool that attempts to provide additional context to events
  through the use of metadata, time series representations and weighted
  and logically grouped result sets. The hope is that these views will
  prompt questions that otherwise may not have been asked."

| 
| ssldump
| http://www.rtfm.com/ssldump/
| "ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP
  connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret
  them as SSLv3/TLS traffic. When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it
  decodes the records and displays them in a textual form to stdout. If
  provided with the appropriate keying material, it will also decrypt
  the connections and display the application data traffic."
| 
| sslsniff
| http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslsniff/
| "sslsniff is designed to create man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for
  SSL/TLS connections, and dynamically generates certs for the domains
  that are being accessed on the fly. The new certificates are
  constructed in a certificate chain that is signed by any certificate
  that is provided. sslsniff also supports other attacks like
  null-prefix or OCSP attacks to achieve silent interceptions of
  connections when possible."

| 
| tcpdump
| http://www.tcpdump.org/
| "Tcpdump prints out a description of the contents of packets on a
  network interface that match the boolean expression. It can also be
  run with the -w flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a
  file for later analysis, and/or with the -r flag, which causes it to
  read from a saved packet file rather than to read packets from a
  network interface. In all cases, only packets that match expression
  will be processed by tcpdump."
| 
| tcpick
| http://tcpick.sourceforge.net/
| "tcpick is a textmode sniffer libpcap-based that can track, reassemble
  and reorder tcp streams. Tcpick is able to save the captured flows in
  different files or displays them in the terminal, and so it is useful
  to sniff files that are transmitted via ftp or http. It can display
  all the stream on the terminal, when the connection is closed in
  different display modes like hexdump, hexdump + ascii, only printable
  charachters, raw mode and so on. Available a color mode too, helpful
  to read and understand better the output of the program. Actually it
  can handle several interfaces, including ethernet cards and ppp. It is
  useful to keep track of what users of a network are doing, and is
  usable with textmode tools like grep, sed, awk."
| 
| tcpreplay
| http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/
| "Tcpreplay is a suite of GPLv3 licensed tools written by Aaron Turner
  for UNIX (and Win32 under Cygwin) operating systems which gives you
  the ability to use previously captured traffic in libpcap format to
  test a variety of network devices. It allows you to classify traffic
  as client or server, rewrite Layer 2, 3 and 4 headers and finally
  replay the traffic back onto the network and through other devices
  such as switches, routers, firewalls, NIDS and IPS's. Tcpreplay
  supports both single and dual NIC modes for testing both sniffing and
  inline devices."
