Naming Convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our goal is to allow you to easily guess and type the URL of the documentation you want to go to.

| For example, if you want to read more about Suricata, you can type the following into your browser: 
| https://securityonion.net/docs/suricata

To achieve this goal, new documentation pages should use the following naming convention:

- all lowercase
- ``.rst`` file extension
- ideally, the name of the page should be one simple word (for example: ``suricata.rst``)
- try to avoid symbols if possible
- if symbols are required, use hyphens (NOT underscores)
