Questions/Problems
------------------

Start a new discussion instead of replying to an old one
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please search the forum to see if you can find similar discussions that may help you. However, please do not reply to old discussions with your new issue. Instead, please start a new discussion and provide a hyperlink to the related discussion.

Avoid generic OS questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Security Onion is based on a standard Linux distribution. In order to keep the signal-to-noise ratio as high as possible, the Security Onion forums should only be used for questions directly relating to Security Onion itself. If you have generic questions about Linux, you should search Google for other forums or relevant information.

Provide sufficient technical info
