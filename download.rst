Download
========

Before downloading, we highly recommend that you review the :ref:`release-notes` section so that you are aware of all recent changes!

.. warning::

   **ALWAYS verify the checksum of the ISO image before booting!** This ensures that the ISO image hasn't been tampered with or corrupted during download. If it fails to verify, try downloading again. If it still fails to verify, try downloading from another computer or another network.

Download and verify our ISO image as shown at https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/2.4/main/DOWNLOAD_AND_VERIFY_ISO.md.

.. warning::

   Antivirus software may alert on the ISO image but any alerts are most likely false positives. If you look at the antivirus scan details, it will most likely tell you that it alerted on a file in ``SecurityOnion\agrules\``. These are rules that look for malicious activity but the rules themselves are not actually malicious.
   
.. note::

  If you're going to create a bootable USB from the ISO image, there are many ways to do that.  One popular choice that seems to work well for many folks is Balena Etcher which can be downloaded at https://www.balena.io/etcher/.
