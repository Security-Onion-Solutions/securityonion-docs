Managing Alerts
===============

Security Onion generates a lot of valuable information for you the second you plug it into a TAP or SPAN port. Between :ref:`zeek` logs, alert data from :ref:`suricata`, and full packet capture from :ref:`stenographer`, you have enough information to begin identifying areas of interest and making positive changes to your security stance.

.. note::

   Network Security Monitoring, as a practice, is not a solution you can plug into your network, make sure you see blinking lights and tell people you are "secure." It requires active intervention from an analyst to qualify the quantity of information presented. One of those regular interventions is to ensure that you are tuning properly and proactively attempting to reach an acceptable level of signal to noise.
   
Alerting Engines & Severity
---------------------------
There are two alerting engines within Security Onion: :ref:`suricata` and :ref:`playbook` (Sigma). Though each engine uses its own severity level system, Security Onion converts that to a standardized alert severity: 

``event.severity``: ``4`` ==> ``event.severity_label``: ``critical``

``event.severity``: ``3`` ==> ``event.severity_label``: ``high``

``event.severity``: ``2`` ==> ``event.severity_label``: ``medium``

``event.severity``: ``1`` ==> ``event.severity_label``: ``low``

All alerts are viewable in :ref:`alerts`, :ref:`dashboards`, :ref:`hunt`, and :ref:`kibana`.

NIDS Testing
------------

The easiest way to test that our NIDS is working as expected might be to simply access http://testmynids.org/uid/index.html from a machine that is being monitored by Security Onion. You can do so via the command line using ``curl``:

   ::
   
      curl testmynids.org/uid/index.html

Alternatively, you could also test for additional hits with a utility called ``tmNIDS``, running the tool in interactive mode:

  ::

      curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xtf/testmynids.org/master/tmNIDS -o /tmp/tmNIDS && chmod +x /tmp/tmNIDS && /tmp/tmNIDS
    
If everything is working correctly, you should see a corresponding alert (``GPL ATTACK_RESPONSE id check returned root``) in :ref:`alerts`, :ref:`dashboards`, :ref:`hunt`, or :ref:`kibana`. If you do not see this alert, try checking to see if the rule is enabled in ``/opt/so/rules/nids/all.rules``:

   ::
   
      grep 2100498 /opt/so/rules/nids/all.rules
      
You can also test using :ref:`so-test`.

Identifying rule categories
---------------------------

Rulesets come with a large number of rules enabled (over 20,000 by default). You should only run the rules necessary for your environment, so you may want to disable entire categories of rules that don't apply to you. Run the following command to get a listing of categories and the number of rules in each:

::

    cut -d\" -f2 /opt/so/rules/nids/all.rules | grep -v "^$" | grep -v "^#" | awk '{print $1, $2}'|sort |uniq -c |sort -nr

So what's next?
---------------

In tuning your sensor, you must first understand whether or not taking corrective actions on this signature will lower your overall security stance. For some alerts, your understanding of your own network and the business being transacted across it will be the deciding factor. For example, if you don't care that users are accessing Facebook, then you can silence the policy-based signatures for Facebook access.

Another consideration is whether or not the traffic is being generated by a misconfigured piece of equipment. If it is, then the most expedient measure may be to resolve the misconfiguration and then reinvestigate tuning.

There are multiple ways to handle overly productive signatures and we'll try to cover as many as we can without producing a full novel on the subject.

Disable the SID
---------------

You can disable a SID by going to :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> idstools --> sids --> disabled.

If you want to disable multiple rules at one time, you can use a regular expression, but make sure you enclose the full entry in single quotes like this:

::

         're:heartbleed'

Modify the SID
--------------

You can modify a SID by going to :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> idstools --> sids --> modify.

To include an escaped ``$`` character in the regex pattern you'll need to make sure it's properly escaped. For example, if you want to modify SID 2009582 and change ``$EXTERNAL_NET`` to ``$HOME_NET``:

::

	2009582 "\\\$EXTERNAL_NET" "\$HOME_NET"
	
The first string is a regex pattern, while the second is just a raw value. You'll need to ensure the first of the two properly escapes any characters that would be interpreted by regex. The second only needs the ``$`` character escaped to prevent bash from treating that as a variable.

Rewrite the signature
---------------------

In some cases, you may not want to use the modify option above, but instead create a copy of the rule and disable the original. You can add local rules by going to :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> idstools --> rules --> Local Rules.

After pasting the rule, you may want to bump the SID into the 90,000,000 range and set the revision to 1. Then make any other changes to the rule. Now that we have a signature that will generate alerts a little more selectively, we need to disable the original SID as shown above.

Threshold
---------

You can manage threshold entries for :ref:`suricata` by going to :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> suricata --> config --> threshold-file.

Please note that :ref:`suricata` 6 has a 64-character limitation on the IP field in a threshold. You can read more about this at https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/4377.

Suppressions
------------

A suppression rule allows you to make some finer grained decisions about certain rules without the onus of rewriting them. With this functionality we can suppress rules based on their signature, the source or destination address and even the IP or full CIDR network block. This way, you still have the basic ruleset, but the situations in which they fire are altered. It's important to note that with this functionality, care should be given to the suppressions being written to make sure they do not suppress legitimate alerts.

Flowbits
--------

``idstools`` may seem like it is ignoring your disabled rules request if you try to disable a rule that has flowbits set.

.. note::

	For a quick primer on flowbits, see https://blog.snort.org/2011/05/resolving-flowbit-dependancies.html.

For example, consider the following rules that reference the ``ET.MSSQL`` flowbit.

First rule:

::

       alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET !1433 (msg:"ET POLICY Outbound MSSQL Connection to Non-Standard Port - Likely Malware"; flow:to_server,established; content:"|12 01 00|"; depth:3; content:"|00 00 00 00 00 00 15 00 06 01 00 1b 00 01 02 00 1c 00|"; distance:1; within:18; content:"|03 00|"; distance:1; within:2; content:"|00 04 ff 08 00 01 55 00 00 00|"; distance:1; within:10; flowbits:set,ET.MSSQL; classtype:bad-unknown; sid:2013409; rev:3;)

Second rule:

::

       alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET 1433 (msg:"ET POLICY Outbound MSSQL Connection to Standard port (1433)"; flow:to_server,established; content:"|12 01 00|"; depth:3; content:"|00 00 00 00 00 00 15 00 06 01 00 1b 00 01 02 00 1c 00|"; distance:1; within:18; content:"|03 00|"; distance:1; within:2; content:"|00 04 ff 08 00 01 55 00 00 00|"; distance:1; within:10; flowbits:set,ET.MSSQL; classtype:bad-unknown; sid:2013410; rev:4;)

Third rule:

::

       alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET !1433 (msg:"ET TROJAN Bancos.DV MSSQL CnC Connection Outbound"; flow:to_server,established; flowbits:isset,ET.MSSQL; content:"|49 00 B4 00 4D 00 20 00 54 00 48 00 45 00 20 00 4D 00 41 00 53 00 54 00 45 00 52 00|"; classtype:trojan-activity; sid:2013411; rev:1;)

If you try to disable the first two rules without disabling the third rule (which has ``flowbits:isset,ET.MSSQL``) the third rule could never fire due to one of the first two rules needing to fire first. idstools helpfully resolves all of your flowbit dependencies, and in this case, is "re-enabling" that rule for you on the fly. Disabling all three of those rules by adding the following to ``disablesid.conf`` has the obvious negative effect of disabling all three of the rules:

::

       1:2013409
       1:2013410
       1:2013411

When you run ``sudo so-rule-update``, watch the "Setting Flowbit State..." section and you can see that if you disable all three (or however many rules share that flowbit) that the "Enabled XX flowbits" line is decremented and all three rules should then be disabled in your ``all.rules``.
