Suricata
========

From https://suricata-ids.org:

    Suricata is a free and open source, mature, fast and robust network threat detection engine. Suricata inspects the network traffic using
    a powerful and extensive rules and signature language, and has powerful Lua scripting support for detection of complex threats.

Suricata NIDS alerts can be found in :ref:`alerts`, :ref:`hunt`, and :ref:`kibana`. Here's an example of Suricata NIDS alerts in :ref:`alerts`:

.. image:: images/alerts.png
  :target: _images/alerts.png
  
If enabled, Suricata metadata (protocol logs) can be found in :ref:`hunt` and :ref:`kibana`.

Community ID
------------

Security Onion enables Suricata's native support for :ref:`community-id`.

Performance
-----------

Suricata uses :ref:`af-packet` to allow you to spin up multiple workers to handle more traffic.  

To change the number of Suricata workers:

-  Stop sensor processes:

   ::

      sudo so-suricata-stop

-  Edit ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls`` and change the ``suriprocs`` variable to the desired number of workers.

-  Start sensor processes:

   ::

      sudo so-suricata-start

.. seealso::

    | For other tuning considerations, please see:
    | https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/performance/tuning-considerations.html

For best performance, Suricata should be pinned to specific CPUs. In most cases, youâ€™ll want to pin sniffing processes to a CPU in the same Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) domain that your sniffing NIC is bound to.  Accessing a CPU in the same NUMA domain is faster than across a NUMA domain.  

.. seealso::

    | For more information about determining NUMA domains using ``lscpu`` and ``lstopo``, please see:
    | https://github.com/brokenscripts/cpu_pinning
    
To pin Suricata workers to specific CPUs:

- Stop sensor processes:

  ::

     sudo so-suricata-stop
       
- Edit ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls`` and add the following under ``sensor:`` 

  ::
  
     suri_pins:  
       - <cpu_1>  
       - <cpu_2>  
       - <cpu_3> 

- Note: To avoid inconsistent Suricata workers being allocated, ensure ``suriprocs`` is removed from under ``sensor:`` or is equivalent to the number of cpu cores being pinned. 

- Start sensor processes:

  ::
  
     sudo so-suricata-start
     
HOME_NET
--------

To configure HOME_NET, please see the :ref:`homenet` section. 

Configuration
-------------

You can configure Suricata's ``suricata.yaml`` using :ref:`salt`. The defaults for this have been defined in https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/salt/suricata/defaults.yaml. Under ``suricata:config``, the pillar structure follows the same YAML structure of the ``suricata.yaml`` file. 

For example, suppose you want to change Suricata's ``EXTERNAL_NET`` setting from the default of ``any`` to ``!$HOME_NET``. You could add the following to the global pillar file (``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/global.sls``) or minion pillar file (``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls``) on the manager:

::

    suricata:
      config:
        vars:
          address-groups:
            EXTERNAL_NET: "!$HOME_NET"
            
From the manager, then run:

::

    sudo salt $SENSORNAME_$ROLE state.highstate

Some of the settings normally found in ``suricata.yaml`` can be found in the sensor pillar instead of the Suricata pillar. These options are: ``HOMENET``, ``default-packet-size``, and the CPU affinity settings for pinning the processes to CPU cores or how many processes to run.

If you would like to configure/manage IDS rules, please see the :ref:`rules` and :ref:`managing-alerts` sections.

Thresholding
------------

To enable thresholding for SIDS, reference the example pillar at https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/pillar/thresholding/pillar.example. 

To view the acceptable syntax, view the file located at https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/pillar/thresholding/pillar.usage. 

This pillar can be added to :ref:`salt` in either the global pillar file (``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/global.sls``) or minion pillar file (``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls``).

.. warning::

   Salt sls files are in YAML format. When editing these files, please be very careful to respect YAML syntax, especially whitespace. For more information, please see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/troubleshooting/yaml_idiosyncrasies.html.

Metadata
--------

Depending on what options you choose in Setup, it may ask if you want to use :ref:`zeek` or :ref:`suricata` for metadata. If you choose :ref:`suricata` and later find that some metadata is unnecessary, you can filter out the unnecessary metadata by writing rules. We have included some examples at https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/dev/salt/idstools/sorules/filters.rules.

The global pillar on your manager node controls the metadata engine on each sensor. Only one metadata engine at a time is supported.

To change your grid's metadata engine from Zeek to Suricata:

-  On the manager, edit the global pillar file (``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/global.sls``) and change the ``mdengine`` variable from ``ZEEK`` to ``SURICATA``.

-  Stop Zeek on all nodes:

   ::

      sudo salt '*' cmd.run 'so-zeek-stop'

-  Update all nodes:

   ::

      sudo salt '*' state.highstate

File Extraction
---------------

If you choose Suricata for metadata, it will extract files from network traffic and :ref:`strelka` will then analyze those extracted files. If you would like to extract additional file types, then you can add file types as shown at https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/dev/salt/idstools/sorules/extraction.rules.

Disabling
---------

Starting in Security Onion 2.3.80, Suricata can be disabled by setting ``enabled: false`` in the ``suricata`` :ref:`salt` pillar.

If you just want to disable Suricata on a single sensor, then you can edit that sensor's ``minion.sls`` file. If the file doesn't already have a ``suricata`` section, then add the following to the end of the file:

::

	suricata:
	  enabled: false

If you want to disable Suricata globally across all your sensors, then you could add that entry to your ``global.sls`` file.


Diagnostic Logging
------------------

If you need to troubleshoot Suricata, check ``/opt/so/log/suricata/suricata.log``.

Stats
-----
