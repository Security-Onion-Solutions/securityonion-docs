| The Elastic Stack consists of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana and replaces ELSA.
| 
| hping
| http://www.hping.org/
| "hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features."
| 
| hunt
| "Advanced packet sniffer and connection intrusion. Hunt is a program for intruding into a connection, watching it and resetting it. Note that hunt is operating on Ethernet and is best used for connections which can be watched through it. However, it is possible to do something even for hosts on another segments or hosts that are on switched ports."
| 
| labrea
| http://labrea.sourceforge.net/labrea-info.html
| "LaBrea takes over unused IP addresses, and creates virtual servers that are attractive to worms, hackers, and other denizens of the Internet. The program answers connection attempts in such a way that the machine at the other end gets "stuck", sometimes for a very long time."
| 
| mergecap
| http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/mergecap.html
| "Mergecap is a program that combines multiple saved capture files into a single output file specified by the -w argument. Mergecap knows how to read libpcap capture files, including those of tcpdump, Wireshark, and other tools that write captures in that format."
| 
| netsed
| "The network packet altering stream editor NetSED is small and handful utility designed to alter the contents of packets forwarded through your network in real time. It is really useful for network hackers in following applications: black-box protocol auditing - whenever there are two or more proprietary boxes communicating over undocumented protocol (by enforcing changes in ongoing transmissions, you will be able to test if tested application is secure), fuzz-alike experiments, integrity tests - whenever you want to test stability of the application and see how it ensures data integrity, other common applications - fooling other people, content filtering, etc etc - choose whatever you want to. It perfectly fits ngrep, netcat and tcpdump tools suite."

It currently recognizes IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands BPF filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop."
| 
| p0f
| http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/
| "P0f is a tool that utilizes an array of sophisticated, purely passive traffic fingerprinting mechanisms to identify the players behind any incidental TCP/IP communications (often as little as a single normal SYN) without interfering in any way. Version 3 is a complete rewrite of the original codebase, incorporating a significant number of improvements to network-level fingerprinting, and introducing the ability to reason about application-level payloads (e.g., HTTP)."
| 
| Reassembler

| 
| scapy
| http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/
| "Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation program. It is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more. It can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery (it can replace hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, tethereal, p0f, etc.). It also performs very well at a lot of other specific tasks that most other tools can't handle, like sending invalid frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics (VLAN hopping+ARP cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted channel, ...), etc."
| 
| sguil

Sguil's main component is an intuitive GUI that provides access to realtime events, session data, and raw packet captures. Sguil facilitates the practice of Network Security Monitoring and event driven analysis. The Sguil client is written in tcl/tk and can be run on any operating system that supports tcl/tk (including Linux, BSD, Solaris, MacOS, and Win32)."
| 
| Sniffit
| http://sniffit.sourceforge.net/
| "SniffIt is a Distribted Sniffer System, which allows users to capture network traffic from an unique machine using a graphical client application. This feature is very useful in switched networks, where traditional sniffers only allow users to sniff their own network traffic."
| 
| Snort

Squert is a visual tool that attempts to provide additional context to events through the use of metadata, time series representations and weighted and logically grouped result sets. The hope is that these views will prompt questions that otherwise may not have been asked."
| 
| ssldump
| https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssldump
| "ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret them as SSLv3/TLS traffic. When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it decodes the records and displays them in a textual form to stdout. If provided with the appropriate keying material, it will also decrypt the connections and display the application data traffic."
| 
| sslsniff
| http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslsniff/
| "sslsniff is designed to create man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for SSL/TLS connections, and dynamically generates certs for the domains that are being accessed on the fly. The new certificates are constructed in a certificate chain that is signed by any certificate that is provided. sslsniff also supports other attacks like null-prefix or OCSP attacks to achieve silent interceptions of connections when possible."

| 
| tcpdump
| http://www.tcpdump.org/
| "Tcpdump prints out a description of the contents of packets on a network interface that match the boolean expression. It can also be run with the -w flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a file for later analysis, and/or with the -r flag, which causes it to read from a saved packet file rather than to read packets from a network interface. In all cases, only packets that match expression will be processed by tcpdump."
| 
| tcpick
| http://tcpick.sourceforge.net/
| "tcpick is a textmode sniffer libpcap-based that can track, reassemble and reorder tcp streams. Tcpick is able to save the captured flows in different files or displays them in the terminal, and so it is useful to sniff files that are transmitted via ftp or http. It can display all the stream on the terminal, when the connection is closed in different display modes like hexdump, hexdump + ascii, only printable charachters, raw mode and so on. Available a color mode too, helpful to read and understand better the output of the program. Actually it can handle several interfaces, including ethernet cards and ppp. It is useful to keep track of what users of a network are doing, and is usable with textmode tools like grep, sed, awk."
| 
| tcpreplay
| http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/
| "Tcpreplay is a suite of GPLv3 licensed tools written by Aaron Turner for UNIX (and Win32 under Cygwin) operating systems which gives you the ability to use previously captured traffic in libpcap format to test a variety of network devices. It allows you to classify traffic as client or server, rewrite Layer 2, 3 and 4 headers and finally replay the traffic back onto the network and through other devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, NIDS and IPS's. Tcpreplay supports both single and dual NIC modes for testing both sniffing and inline devices."
