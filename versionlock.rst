Version Lock
============

This feature can be used to prevent packages from being upgraded. It is commonly referred to as "locking" or "holding" packages. The most frequent use case is holding the kernel to prevent frequent system reboots.

Holding Packages
----------------

To hold a package, add its name to the ``hold`` list in :ref:`administration` → Configuration → versionlock → hold.
