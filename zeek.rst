Zeek
====

Zeek is formerly known as Bro.  From https://www.zeek.org/:

    Zeek is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know. (Zeek is the new name for the long-established Bro system. Note that parts of the system retain the "Bro" name, and it also often appears in the documentation and distributions.)

Zeek logs are sent to :ref:`elasticsearch` for parsing and storage and can then be found in :ref:`hunt` and :ref:`kibana`. Here's an example of Zeek conn (connection) logs in :ref:`hunt`:

  :target: _images/hunt.png
  
Community ID
------------

Security Onion enables Zeek's native support for :ref:`community-id`.

Performance
-----------

Zeek uses :ref:`af-packet` so that you can spin up multiple Zeek workers to handle more traffic.  

To change the number of AF-PACKET workers for :ref:`zeek`:

-  Stop Zeek:

   ::

      sudo so-zeek-stop

-  Edit ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls`` and change the ``zeek_lbprocs`` variable to the desired number of cores.

-  Start Zeek:

   ::

      sudo so-zeek-start
      
For best performance, Zeek should be pinned to specific CPUs.  CPUs can be pinned in one of 2 methods, locally in the Zeek configuration or from the manager through salt files.  Locally within Zeek you can use the ``pin_cpus`` setting as shown at https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/configuration/#using-pf-ring.  Set CPU pinning within ``/opt/so/conf/zeek/node.cfg`` on a node running Zeek using ``pin_cpus`` in the following format:
::

  pin_cpus=1,2,11,12
  
It is also possible to set CPU pinning using ``zeek_pins`` within the salt files, this should only be added to salt files for roles which are running zeek, such as a Sensor Role.  When setting CPU pinning the ``zeek_lbprocs`` should match the number of pinned CPUS. Set CPU pinning in the salt files using ``zeek_pins`` in following method:

::
   
   sensor:
     zeek_pins:
       - 1
       - 2
       - 11
       - 12  

In most cases, you’ll want to pin sniffing processes to a CPU in the same Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) domain that your sniffing NIC is bound to.  Accessing a CPU in the same NUMA domain is faster than across a NUMA domain.  See the following for an in-depth overview, as well as how to determine NUMA domains using ``lscpu`` and ``lstopo``.

Email
-----

To configure email notifications, please see the :ref:`email` section.

Syslog
------

To forward Zeek logs to an external syslog collector, please see the :ref:`syslog-output` section.

Intel
-----

You can add your own intel to ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/intel/intel.dat`` on the manager and then run ``sudo salt $SENSORNAME_$ROLE state.highstate``. When writing this file, ensure there are no leading/trailing spaces or lines, and that only a single tab is used to separate fields. If you experience an error, or do not notice ``/nsm/zeek/logs/current/intel.log`` being generated, try having a look in ``/nsm/zeek/logs/current/reporter.log`` for clues. You may also want to restart Zeek after making changes by running ``sudo so-zeek-restart``.

Custom Scripts
--------------

Custom scripts can be added to ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/custom/<$custom-module>`` on the manager.  The custom folder is mapped to Zeek through Docker on the minions.  Once the script module is created, the configuration for ``local.zeek`` will need to be updated.  In Security Onion 2, this configuration is abstracted into a SaltStack pillar.  For example, we would copy ``/opt/so/saltstack/default/pillar/zeek/init.sls`` to ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/zeek/init.sls``, and add our custom module to be loaded by Zeek (alternatively, the pillar could be modified in the ``global.sls`` file.  More details can be found here here: https://docs.securityonion.net/en/latest/zeek.html#configuration):

::

      '@load':

        - securityonion/communityid
        - securityonion/file-extraction
        - custom/$module-name
      
One the configuration has been updated, Zeek can be restarted with ``sudo so-zeek-restart`` on applicable nodes to pick up the changes.  Finally, ``/nsm/zeek/logs/current/loaded_scripts.log`` can be checked to ensure the new module has been loaded. For example:

::

    grep mynewmodule /nsm/zeek/logs/current/loaded_scripts.log

Logs
----

Zeek logs are stored in ``/nsm/zeek/logs``. They are collected by :ref:`filebeat`, parsed by and stored in :ref:`elasticsearch`, and viewable in :ref:`hunt` and :ref:`kibana`.

We configure Zeek to output logs in JSON format. If you need to parse those JSON logs from the command line, you can use :ref:`jq`.

If you want to specify what Zeek logs are ingested, you can use :ref:`so-zeek-logs`.

Zeek monitors your network traffic and creates logs, such as:

conn.log
~~~~~~~~

-  TCP/UDP/ICMP connections

| ...and others, which can be researched here:
| https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/script-reference/log-files.html

As you can see, Zeek log data can provide a wealth of information to the analyst, all easily accessible through :ref:`hunt` or :ref:`kibana`.

Configuration
-------------
You can use :ref:`salt` to manage Zeek's ``local.zeek``, ``node.cfg`` and ``zeekctl.cfg``:
 
``local.zeek``: The allowed options for this file are ``@load``, ``@load-sigs`` and ``redef``. An example of configuring this pillar can be seen below. 
 
``node.cfg``: The pillar items to modify this file are located under the sensor pillar in the minion pillar file. The options that can be customized in the file include: ``interface``, ``lb_procs``, ``pin_cpus``, and ``af_packet_buffer_size``.
 
``zeekctl.cfg``: An example of customizing this can be seen below. The allowed options can be seen in https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/salt/zeek/files/zeekctl.cfg.jinja.

Here is an example of how we would modify ``local.zeek``. We can see the default pillar assignments used for ``local.zeek`` in ``/opt/so/saltstack/default/pillar/zeek/init.sls``. This file should never be modified as it could be updated in the future and any modification made would be overwritten. The global or minion pillar files should be used for making changes as they are stored in ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/``, and that directory isn’t overwritten during a Security Onion code update.

In this file, there are two keys under zeek, ``zeekctl`` and ``local``. We will be using ``zeek:local`` for this example since we are modifying the ``zeek.local`` file. We will address ``zeek:zeekctl`` in another example where we modify the ``zeekctl.cfg`` file. 

Under ``zeek:local``, there are three keys: ``@load``, ``@load-sigs``, and ``redef``. In the pillar definition, ``@load`` and ``@load-sigs`` are wrapped in quotes due to the ``@`` character. Under each of the keys, there is a list of  items that will be added to the ``local.zeek`` file with the appropriate directive of either ``@load``, ``@load-sigs`` or ``redef``. In order to modify either of the lists, the entire list must redefined in either the global or minion pillar file.

If we have a node where ``protocols/ssh/detect-bruteforcing`` is generating a lot of noise and we want to tell Zeek to stop loading that script, we would do the following. Since we just want to turn it off for that specific node, we would open ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls``. At the bottom, we would append the following:

::

   zeek:
     local:
       '@load':
         - misc/loaded-scripts
         - tuning/defaults
         - misc/capture-loss
         - misc/stats
         - frameworks/software/vulnerable
         - frameworks/software/version-changes

         - protocols/dns/detect-external-names
         - protocols/ftp/detect
         - protocols/conn/known-hosts
         - protocols/conn/known-services
         - protocols/ssl/known-certs
         - protocols/ssl/validate-certs
         - protocols/ssl/log-hostcerts-only
         - protocols/ssh/geo-data
         - protocols/ssh/interesting-hostnames
         - protocols/http/detect-sqli
         - frameworks/files/hash-all-files
         - frameworks/files/detect-MHR
         - policy/frameworks/notice/extend-email/hostnames
         - ja3
         - hassh
         - intel
         - cve-2020-0601
         - securityonion/bpfconf
         - securityonion/communityid
         - securityonion/file-extraction

We redefined the ``@load`` list in the minion pillar file, but we left out the ```protocols/ssh/detect-bruteforcing``. This will override the value defined in the ``/opt/so/saltstack/default/pillar/zeek/init.sls`` and the global pillar file if it is defined there, and prevent the script from being added to the ``local.zeek`` file. If we wanted to add a script to be loaded, then we would add out script to the list. Since we aren’t changing ``@load-sigs`` or ``redef``, then we do not need to add them here. Once the file is saved, and the node checks in the with manager, the ``local.zeek`` file will be updated and the ``so-zeek`` docker container will be restarted.

Let's see an example of how we would modify the ``zeekctl.cfg`` file. From the example above, we know that the default pillar values are set for zeek in ``/opt/so/saltstack/default/pillar/zeek/init.sls``. The default pillar values for ``zeekctl.cfg`` are as follows:

::

   zeek:
     zeekctl:
       MailTo: root@localhost
       MailConnectionSummary: 1
       MinDiskSpace: 5
       MailHostUpDown: 1
       LogRotationInterval: 3600
       LogExpireInterval: 0
       StatsLogEnable: 1
       StatsLogExpireInterval: 0
       StatusCmdShowAll: 0
       CrashExpireInterval: 0
       SitePolicyScripts: local.zeek
       LogDir: /nsm/zeek/logs
       SpoolDir: /nsm/zeek/spool
       CfgDir: /opt/zeek/etc
       CompressLogs: 1

For anything not defined here, Zeek will use its own defaults. The options that are allowed to be managed with the pillar can be found at https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/salt/zeek/files/zeekctl.cfg.jinja.

In order to add or modify an option in ``zeekctl``, we will need to modify either the ``global`` or ``minion`` pillar file. For example, if we wanted to turn log compression off and change the timeout for Broker communication events to 20 seconds globally, we would add the following to the global pillar file.

::

   zeek:
     zeekctl:
       compresslogs: 0
       commtimeout: 20

Since ``zeek:zeekctl`` is a dictionary with dictionary values, we do not need to redefine the entire pillar here like we did for ``zeek:local`` above. Once the pillar file is saved and the node checks in with the manager, the ``zeekctl.cfg`` file will be updated and the ``so-zeek container`` will be restarted.
