Zeek
====

Security Onion includes Zeek for network protocol analysis and metadata.  From https://www.zeek.org/:

    Zeek is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know. (Zeek is the new name for the long-established Bro system. Note that parts of the system retain the "Bro" name, and it also often appears in the documentation and distributions.)

Zeek logs are sent to :ref:`elasticsearch` for parsing and storage and can then be found in :ref:`dashboards`, :ref:`hunt`, and :ref:`kibana`. Here's an example of Zeek logs in :ref:`hunt`:

.. image:: images/56_hunt.png
  :target: _images/56_hunt.png
  
Community ID
------------

Security Onion enables Zeek's built-in support for :ref:`community-id`.

Packet Loss and Capture Loss
----------------------------

Zeek reports both packet loss and capture loss and you can find graphs of these in :ref:`influxdb`. If Zeek reports packet loss, then you most likely need to adjust the number of Zeek workers as shown below or filter out traffic using :ref:`bpf`. If Zeek is reporting capture loss but no packet loss, this usually means that the capture loss is happening upstream in the tap or span port itself.

Configuration
-------------

You can configure Zeek by going to :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> zeek. 

.. image:: images/config-item-zeek.png
  :target: _images/config-item-zeek.png

Zeek logs are consumed by the Elastic Agent (managed by Elastic Fleet) so if you want to configure which Zeek logs are excluded, you can go to :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> elasticfleet --> logging --> zeek --> excluded.

  :target: _images/config-item-elasticfleet.png

HOME_NET
--------

The HOME_NET variable defines the networks that are considered home networks (those networks that you are monitoring and defending). The default value is RFC1918 private address space (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, and 172.16.0.0/12). You can modify this default value by going to :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> zeek --> config --> networks --> HOME_NET.

Performance
-----------

Zeek uses :ref:`af-packet` so that you can spin up multiple Zeek workers to handle more traffic.  

If you have multiple physical CPUs, youâ€™ll most likely want to pin sniffing processes to a CPU in the same Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) domain that your sniffing NIC is bound to.  Accessing a CPU in the same NUMA domain is faster than across a NUMA domain.  

.. note::

    For more information about determining NUMA domains using ``lscpu`` and ``lstopo``, please see https://github.com/brokenscripts/cpu_pinning.

You can modify Zeek worker count by going to :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> zeek --> config --> node --> workers.

Disabling
---------

Zeek can be disabled by going to :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> zeek --> enabled.

Syslog
------

To forward Zeek logs to an external syslog collector, please see the :ref:`syslog-output` section.

Logs
----

Zeek logs are stored in ``/nsm/zeek/logs``. They are collected by :ref:`elastic-agent`, parsed by and stored in :ref:`elasticsearch`, and viewable in :ref:`dashboards`, :ref:`hunt`, and :ref:`kibana`.

We configure Zeek to output logs in JSON format. If you need to parse those JSON logs from the command line, you can use :ref:`jq`.

Zeek monitors your network traffic and logs protocol metadata. Here are just a few examples.

conn.log
~~~~~~~~

-  TCP/UDP/ICMP connections
-  For ICMP connections, ICMP type is logged as source port and ICMP code as destination port
-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/conn/main.zeek.html#type-Conn::Info

dns.log
~~~~~~~

-  DNS activity
-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/dns/main.zeek.html#type-DNS::Info

http.log
~~~~~~~~

-  HTTP requests and replies
-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/http/main.zeek.html#type-HTTP::Info

ssl.log
~~~~~~~

-  SSL/TLS handshake info
-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/ssl/main.zeek.html#type-SSL::Info

notice.log
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Zeek notices
-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/frameworks/notice/main.zeek.html#type-Notice::Info

Other Zeek logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zeek also provides other logs by default and you can read more about them at https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/script-reference/log-files.html.

In addition to Zeek's default logs, we also include protocol analyzers for STUN, TDS, and Wireguard traffic. We also include support for ICS/SCADA protocols such as BACnet, BSAP, CIP, COTP, DNP3, ECAT, ENIP, Modbus, OPC UA, Profinet, and S7. All of these analyzers are enabled by default and you can find corresponding dashboards for each of them in :ref:`dashboards`.

We also include MITRE BZAR scripts and you can read more about them at https://github.com/mitre-attack/bzar. Please note that the MITRE BZAR scripts are disabled by default. If you would like to enable them, you can do so via :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> zeek. Once enabled, you can then check for BZAR detections by going to :ref:`dashboards` and selecting the Zeek Notice dashboard.

As you can see, Zeek log data can provide a wealth of information to the analyst, all easily accessible through :ref:`dashboards`, :ref:`hunt`, or :ref:`kibana`.

VLAN Tags
---------

If your network traffic has VLAN tags, then Zeek will log them in conn.log. :ref:`dashboards` includes a VLAN dashboard which shows this data.

Intel
-----

You can add your own intel to ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/intel/intel.dat`` on the manager and it will automatically replicate to all forward nodes. If the ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/intel/`` directory is empty, you can copy the default files (both ``intel.dat`` and ``__load__.zeek``) from ``/opt/so/saltstack/default/salt/zeek/policy/intel/`` as follows:

::

    sudo cp /opt/so/saltstack/default/salt/zeek/policy/intel/* /opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/intel/

Please note that Zeek is very strict about the format of ``intel.dat``. When editing this file, please follow these guidelines:

- no leading spaces or lines
- separate fields with a single literal tab character
- no trailing spaces or lines

The default ``intel.dat`` file follows these guidelines so you can reference it as an example of the proper format.

When finished editing ``intel.dat``, run ``sudo salt $SENSORNAME_$ROLE state.highstate`` to sync ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/intel/`` to ``/opt/so/conf/zeek/policy/intel/``. If you have a distributed deployment with separate forward nodes, it may take up to 15 minutes for intel to sync to the forward nodes.

If you experience an error, or do not notice ``/nsm/zeek/logs/current/intel.log`` being generated, try having a look in ``/nsm/zeek/logs/current/reporter.log`` for clues. You may also want to restart Zeek after making changes by running ``sudo so-zeek-restart``.

Diagnostic Logging
------------------

Zeek diagnostic logs can be found in ``/nsm/zeek/logs/``. Look for files like ``reporter.log``, ``stats.log``, ``stderr.log``, and ``stdout.log``. Depending on what you're looking for, you may also need to look at the :ref:`docker` logs for the container:

::

        sudo docker logs so-zeek
